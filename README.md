# 2020-COVID-Excess-Deaths
Estimation of excess COVID-related deaths in 24 countries in 2020. Figures from Short Term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF) dataset is used for calculations.

It was the topic of my Master's thesis at the Higher School of Economics, Moscow for the field of Population and Development. In 2020 and most of 2021, governments' interference/downplay in the death statistics was one of the most controversial topics. Using a highly reliable database that consists of weekly mortality counts from nearly all EU countries and most of OECD members, I studied the subject for all available countries. 

Soon I will graph these results to show how destructive COVID-19 pandemic was in 2020 in terms of excess mortality.
